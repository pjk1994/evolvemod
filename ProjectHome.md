## Introduction ##
Evolve is a work in progress admin mod for the Half Life 2 modification Garry's Mod. It will feature almost every useful function found in other well known and proven admin mods, including ASSMod and ULX. Combined with an easy to use GUI the goal of this mod is to become "everything a server owner will ever need".

## Why use Evolve? ##

  * It is an already proven admin mod currently running on 300+ servers.
  * Plugins to expand capabilities are extremely easy to write.
  * It comes with an appealing Sandbox scoreboard.
  * The menu is as compact as ASSMod's, yet it has all the features advanced admin mods like ULX come with.
  * Compared to a mod like ULX it is very lightweight.
  * Development is very active and new features are added almost daily.

## Currently available features ##
  * **Player actions** (Per player no-limits, scaling, unlimited ammo, ...)
  * **Player punishment.** (Igniting, freezing, jailing, ...)
  * **Player administration.** (Kicking and banning, optionally by SteamID)
  * **Extended Sandbox gamemode settings.** (Common limits and options)
  * **Proven stability.**

## Planned features ##
  * MOTD
  * Integration with other gamemodes than Sandbox

## Instructions ##

  * **Listen servers:** When hosting a listen server, you automatically become Owner.
  * **Dedicated servers:** You need to make yourself owner using the command 'ev rank name owner'.
